# Principle R.U.A.
The rua principle is the main guide of code construction in our company. It helps ensure the code extensability and reusability. RUA stands for read, understand and adapt.

## What it means
### R stands for
This is the most basic and everyone knows about it, but this is the foundation for the other parts, without it, understanding and adapting won't be possible.

### U stands for
You read the code, you know what it does, but do you know how it connects to other parts of the code? Do you understand how to make the changes you want, how changeable it is and if it really is necessary? Understanding goes beyond reading, they need to make sense to you.

### A stands for
You may have an easy and understandable code, but does it adapt? Can you reuse this in other projects or parts of the application?
It need to be able to scale to your needs without breaking.
